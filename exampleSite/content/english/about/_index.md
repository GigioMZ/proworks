I am a Architectual Engineer and have been designing for quite sometime now. Please have a look around my galleries (Design and Build Blueprints, building permits, assembly drawings, as built drawings, 3D Solid models, custom home office, 3D Printing, Project Management, Solidworks, Autodesk Inventor, website design [like this one]) while you are here these are projects that I have completed sucessfully and were able to be apart of with thanks to many people who are probably looking at this right now and saying wow this is true.
